# GooseMod (beta)

### **GooseMod is currently in beta, still mostly only recommended for power users and testers**

GooseMod is a tethered (temporary, only lasts until Discord closure), unmodifying (doesn't modify the client's files or code directly) modification / addition to the Discord client. It is "installed" (activated) via pasting JS into the DevTools console.

It works in both the desktop app and in the browser / web app.
